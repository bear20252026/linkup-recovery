     *    holder is what the profile-completion screen reads;
     *  - the token is stored in both cases, so a parked user is signed in but not yet cached.
     *
     * `userId == 0` also stopped the desktop-widget update service and cleared the account LiveData in
     * the original; both belong to the widget/IM cards, so only the cache write is modelled here.
